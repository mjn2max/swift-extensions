## Usage

Swift-Extensions aims for “drop-in” convenience. Just import and use the new methods and computed properties:

**Example 1: Rounding a Double**

```swift
let value = 3.14159
let rounded = value.rounded(toPlaces: 2) // 3.14
```

**Example 2: String Trimming**

```swift
let text = "  Hello World  "
let trimmed = text.trimmed() // "Hello World"
```

**Example 3: UIView Corner Radius**

```swift
let view = UIView()
view.roundCorners(radius: 10)
```

More examples can be found in the [Extensions List](#extensions-list).
